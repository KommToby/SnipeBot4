# SnipeBot4
The upcoming build that will be implemented into the [current snipebot](https://github.com/KommToby/SnipeBot3)
- Efficiency Changes
- Slash Command Support
- Full Refactor & Code Cleanup  
This is in a seperate repo as it is a major update, the whole of SnipeBot3 was built off [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), this is being built off [discord-interactions](https://discord-interactions.readthedocs.io).

## FAQ
**Will my data from SnipeBot3 be moved over?**  
Yes. The old data should all be compatable with the new version

**When is this going to replace SnipeBot3?**  
When I get the main tracker and base commands done, I will push it onto the main bot, but the beta one will stay hidden as dev continues.
