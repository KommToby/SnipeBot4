## FAQ
**Will my data from SnipeBot3 be moved over?**  
Yes. The old data should all be compatable with the new version

**When is this going to replace SnipeBot3?**  
When I get the main tracker and base commands done, I will push it onto the main bot, but the beta one will stay hidden as dev continues.
